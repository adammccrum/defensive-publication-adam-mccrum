 IrisKey.ai – Mobile Carbon-Negative Transportation Platform  
Defensive Publication – 28 November 2025**

IrisKey.ai has invented and reduced to practice (2025) a retrofittable system that turns **any vehicle or mobile machine** (motorcycles → ships) into a **strong net CO₂ sink** with zero powertrain modification.

Publicly disclosed:  
- Harvests multiple forms of waste energy present on all moving/parked machines  
- Powers continuous direct air capture (DAC) of CO₂ from ambient air only  
- Operates full-rate while driving **or parked**  
- Stores compressed/liquefied CO₂ on board  
- Optional on-board synthesis of drop-in fuels from captured CO₂ + H₂  
- Removes far more CO₂ than the host emits, even on gasoline/diesel  
- Fully scalable (<100 kg to ISO-container size)

This disclosure by **IrisKey.ai** on 28 November 2025 establishes worldwide prior art and blocks third-party patents on the concept and obvious variants.
